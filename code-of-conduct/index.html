We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Individuals violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from community spaces at the sole discretion of the community organizers.</p><p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p><ul><li>Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.</li><li>Sexual images in public spaces</li><li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following</li><li>Harassing photography or recording</li><li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events</li><li>Inappropriate physical contact</li><li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li><li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior</li></ul><h3 id=enforcement>ENFORCEMENT</h3><p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p><p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, community organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep community spaces a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from community spaces.</p><p>Community organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting community events or making the environment hostile for any participants.</p><p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all community venues and community-related social activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!</p><h3 id=reporting>REPORTING</h3><p>If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our community for everyone. We want you to be happy in our community. People like you make our community a better place.</p><p>You can make a report by:</p><ul><li>Approaching an organizer at a local meetup.</li><li>Message an organizer in the DevOps MSP slack.</li></ul><p>When taking a report, our organizers will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. They may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we&rsquo;ll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we&rsquo;ll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won&rsquo;t be asked to confront anyone and we won&rsquo;t tell anyone who you are.</p><p>Our organizers will be happy to help you contact security, local law enforcement, local support services, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration of the community event. We value your attendance.</p><p>This anti-harassment policy is based on the <a href=http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment>example policy from the Geek Feminism wiki</a>.</p></section><section class="flex-ns flex-wrap justify-around mt5"></section></article></main><footer class="bg-white bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://devopsmsp.github.io/>&copy; devops MSP 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
