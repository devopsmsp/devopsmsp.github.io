## WHO ARE WE?

We are technology professionals in the Twin Cities metropolitan area of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. On occasion, we get together to hear from speakers, share our own DevOps journeys, and discuss the ways in which we use the principles of DevOps to improve our personal and professional lives.

We encourage any and all who are interested in sharing their experiences or learning more about DevOps to join us in our Slack or at our next conference or meetup.

## EVENTS

Our annual conference, [devopsdays MSP](https://devopsdays.org/minneapolis), is held each summer. See [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/DevOps-Minneapolis/) for info on our occasional meetups.

## WHAT IS DEVOPS?

DevOps, the clipped compound of “development” and “operations”, is a term that practitioners of devops use to describe the implementation of a set of principles that promote an alternative to traditional workplace ideology and culture.

Themes such as empathy, cooperation, and shared responsibility provide a foundation for how groups of people can improve the environments in which they live and work.


## HOW DO I PARTICIPATE?

Participate in the annual conference [devopsdays MSP](https://devopsdays.org/minneapolis) and the community [Slack](/slack). We also host occasional [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/DevOps-Minneapolis/).
